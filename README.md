# My Card

## Our Goal

In this I learned more about how to design user interfaces for Flutter apps.

## What we will create

My Card is a personal business card. Imagine every time we wanted to give someone our contact details or our business card but we didn't have it with us. Well, now we can get them to download our business card as an app.
